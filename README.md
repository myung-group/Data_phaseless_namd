## Paper abstarct

Excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) simulations near conical intersections (CIs) pose significant challenges when using machine learning potentials (MLPs). Although MLPs have gained recognition for their integration into mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods, such as trajectory surface hopping (TSH), and their capacity to model correlated electron-nuclear dynamics efficiently, difficulties persist in managing nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, singularities at CIs and double-valued coupling elements result in discontinuities that disrupt the smoothness of predictive functions. Partial solutions have been provided by learning diabatic Hamiltonians with phaseless loss functions to these challenges. However, a definitive method for addressing the discontinuities caused by CIs and double-valued coupling elements has yet to be developed. Here, we introduce the phaseless coupling term, $\Delta^2$, derived from the square of the off-diagonal elements of the diabatic Hamiltonian in the SSR(2,2) formalism. This approach improves the stability and accuracy of MLP model by addressing the issues arising from CI singularities and double-valued coupling functions. We apply this method to the penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (PSB3), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving MLP training for ML-based nonadiabatic dynamics. Our results show that the $\Delta^2$ based ML-ESMD method can reproduce ab initio ESMD simulations, underscoring its potential and efficiency for broader applications, particularly in large-scale and long-timescale ESMD simulations.
